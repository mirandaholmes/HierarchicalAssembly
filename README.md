# HierarchicalAssembly

This code is made available to reproduce some of the simulations in the following paper, by Miranda Holmes-Cerfon and Mathhieu Wyart: 

* Holmes-Cerfon, M. and Wyart, M., 2025. Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions.  [arXiv:2501.02611](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02611).

The code simulates systems of sticky squares on a square lattice with "hierarchically" chosen interactions, as described in the paper.
